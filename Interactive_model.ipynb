      "======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================\n",
      " The other story was more difficult. I had written a very short short story that was inspired by the book, I even had a script and all that other stuff. All of a sudden I found myself having to go through and actually transcribe and re-write something that has, over its many years, been a few hundred words at the most. One thing that has been a big challenge is that these stories are very emotionally charged pieces based on very simple things that we can all imagine a little bit more, because every now and again, we hear it on the news. I decided to do something different. I'm not really interested in that, I'm interested in writing something that is more emotional. We have an article about the dodo birds, which is the most incredible thing and what is in it is incredible. The question is what's going on with it and why are these animals so vulnerable? So we really started off with a story, and then what happened was the idea was brought up to me to make it about a lot of different things, and in that sense, we actually did that more than the story was about the animals.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was quite a challenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "It wasn't too difficult, but then you need the emotional drive and drive to really go into all of it. So some of it was easyâ€”as I say, I had a really short story called \"Caught in the Act,\" which is the most amazing thing. I had actually made that quite a bit longer, so it had more character and it had more depth and it was all of the same place. It is the most incredible story about a bunch of young kids in a shipwreck, really being on their own in an enormous way in a very strange world. We tried a couple of takes on that. It was a wonderful story and we tried a couple of different things. And then there was the piece that was about the dodo bird. This became harder, and because it was a smaller piece, it required much more precision on the detail level. It also required different emotions. When you are trying to make something so emotional and so personal, you need to be able to do different things. I think it would have been harder to manage and probably took more time to finish, but it is all the same story.\n",
      "\n",
      "In your mind, what drives people to continue searching for a real dodo?\n",
      "\n",
      "The things that make people want to find a real, true dodo is a mixture of the two emotions that I was talking about. There is a part of our DNA that seems to be very connected to places we remember as small children, where it was an exciting place to play and we were playing in the water. And then there is a part of us, and maybe most importantly the dodo bird that exists, that has existed for over 400 years. So in that sense there is a place for this place on one level and a much deeper feeling about the place and the time period. We know more now about what happened to it than we ever thought, so we are much more curious about how the story ends. We want to see one of our own. We want to see who the dodo bird is and how it comes back again. We want to see what was so special about the time in history that it did find itself in the wrong place, which is a very strange place to be the wrong place.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is important about the dodo's journey?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not sure that there is another animal that has had as big a part of history as the dodo bird. It is perhaps the most famous animal of all time and it has an enormous number of stories in its own right. To this day, there are still people who have never heard of dodos and many people who think that dinosaurs had been extinct for a very long time, which is one of the myths that has always surrounded the dodo, that it was this very big creature and as the story goes, it was an incredibly, very intelligent beast. It is important for people to know that it existed as a result of an amazing evolutionary process. Not only was it the result of evolution, but because it survived in the midst of a huge environmental catastrophe. All things happening at the same time that is quite an amazing combination of circumstances in human history and it has to be remembered to try and understand the world, and to make better decisions in how we live. There are so many things we can learn from people to make our lives better.<|endoftext|>The New Hampshire Republican has the first question at his first town-hall-style meeting Thursday night.

      "What do you think?<|endoftext|>The recent decision by European Union Court of Justice that the copyright on a work of art is exclusive and has to be reserved by a copyright owner for 70 years, has had the effect of further increasing the cost of music publishing. The cost of music has risen at twice the rate of all other publishing sectors since 2009.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the industry this should not be surprising: The EU Court has given the copyright law a retroactive effect and has imposed a statutory obligation on owners of the exclusive right in a work to allow the same right to become available to the public. The effect of this measure is to increase the publishing costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "This does not mean that the copyright law does not have a role for new creators. Some rights to music are available without a fee, for example, those rights to the music that is published on the Internet (for example, streaming of audio content and video) and those whose work is a part of a documentary. However, the European Court recently ruled that the copyright on a work of art is exclusive and has to be reserved for 70 years, and therefore these new creators do not have any rights to use the work. Their only recourse is to publish the copyright on the website of the work and make the book available to the public, and this will likely lead to even higher publishing costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the European Commission, we are considering ways to address some of those costs, including measures aimed at reducing digital locks, increasing access to the information on music and other media used for a sound recording, and making it easier for creators to gain or renew the exclusive copyright on works of art.<|endoftext|>I'm pretty sure I was the only one who read this entire thread and only then got to the part where we were asked to vote here.\n",

We have some examples, such as the US Constitution being the supreme law in the US, or that the US is a \"government to the people and for the people\". We do have other countries that are free, to that extent. However, we also have many examples of countries which are not. I'm not going to pretend this is a scientific survey here, but I'll answer your question anyways.\n",

      "\n",
      "We could have a discussion about freedom in certain societies with respect to certain subjects like sexual behaviour, political freedom or the use of violence to achieve one's will. In the most literal sense the \"free world\" is the world where \"all men are created equal\" and the political freedoms are as such.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, in the broader sense \"freedom\" could be defined a thousand different ways and \"freedom\" could be associated with many things in many different cultures. For example, freedom could be associated with something like freedom of speech, the freedom to assemble and the freedoms to be a person or, if you are a political party like Fascist or Communist, you could also get some freedoms to force others to follow your views, as in the case of the Soviet Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then of course there's some freedoms of the people the \"free world\" does not allow like freedom of religion, the freedom to make a living, etc. However, freedom can also be defined in a much broader sense. Freedom can be thought of as something as a person has total control over his actions. The \"free world\" might not respect this, but they also don't need to. They might not respect the fact that you are going to take drugs to get in touch with the \"soul\" (as you said in the thread, you think this is a good thing, but also think of the repercussions of this), but they don't need to be free of it either.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course freedom can be restricted by force in many ways. Freedom to say \"go\", freedom to kill, death penalty as well as other forms of repression that is a common thing in so many dictatorships would not be a part of freedom in the free world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, if you believe in the \"free world\" but you disagree with certain freedoms, there is another term for such people: \"authoritarians\". However, in that case you don't really agree (I guess) with this concept, then you would be considered an \"authoritarian\". In fact, I wouldn't be too far off to assume that being an \"authoritarian\" is an acceptable label for people who want to reject freedom from \"the free world\", though a bit much is required.\n",

      "In order to avoid the legal issues that sometimes come from the publication and distribution of non Japanese works published in the West, a \"Japanese Only\" tag was created on the top of my website for my reviews and analysis. The purpose of this tag was to prevent westerners from finding my review, so that it would not be seen in English translation. However, this tag did not stop me from reading some western publications, since I am very familiar with the language of the people publishing the pieces (I am the Managing Editor of an English language Japan review website, and have lived in Japan for the past 4 years). In my opinion, I have no problem with this tag. I do however think that it might be necessary to update the copyright page regarding Japanese original works that are translated into English.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the best things that can happen to a Japanese translator is to see the translation evolve. When I began researching for this translation, the most common article on the page was a translation by the famous German translator Hans Christian Andersen. From that page, I learned how to translate other classical works, such as Ulysses and The Odyssey, while still being faithful to the original language. These years have allowed me a lot of opportunity to improve what I have published so far. While many books and articles on the site are based on Andersen's translation of works such as The Snow Queen by Charles Perrault, my original translations are a little more original, which means they are definitely in Japanese.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a few ideas for how to improve the existing translations as well. At the moment, they are in the process of being translated into Chinese and Vietnamese, which will give the book some additional languages. If there are any translators who would be willing to volunteer their skills for the job, be in touch. I would definitely be very happy to hear from any one of you who is familiar with Japanese and would like to take up the challenge.\n",

      " In this dystopian novel, a child born with a rare and deadly blood disorder is sent to a secret colony on an alien planet in order to help save the Earth. As in many dystopian futures, the children on this colony are taught to revere their genetically engineered hosts. As they grow older, the children will discover that their new genetic bodies are flawed, and their new hosts are not the same as their original selves. And as the children realize they can't control their own destinies on this new world, they must choose whether to be human once again or return to their genetic state. Nora Roberts is widely considered one of the great sf writers of the last decade, and in this book she shows us her own vision of what might be. The key has been given to me to try and find my place in this world and the people in it. The future is full of confusion and possibility and that's a wonderful thing. I hope this is the way the future will be. As a child of the new century, I find myself wishing that I can feel hopeful. I want something to be certain.\"-Rita Mae Brown, in The New Yorker\n",

In the end, the key doesn't make the child free, but for the very same reasons that it doesn't make the parent â€” for the same reason we keep a key in our car â€” we don't see the life we are making for the child that we are letting slip away.\"-Cary Estabrooks, Bookforum\n",

      "\"Nora Roberts's latest novel, The Key by Nora Roberts, is one of her most disturbing. While her debut feature, The Manta Ray, set the template for her best work, this disturbing, unsettling novel is a new world entirely... There are no heroines in the novel; there are no happy endings. Every major character is a terrifying, alien version of you. This is a book of despair and fear, which makes it a frightening read. I am sorry to say that none of the book's characters has a happy ending, which may make you afraid to read it.\"-Chris Kraus in the Los Angeles Times\n",

If I had wanted to read a story about the end of the world, one filled with despair and cruelty, I would've read her last novel, The Manta Ray... The key does indeed make the child free, but only because it has made us the parents of the very small children who are doomed to grow up without understanding or compassion. And the key does help us feel more secure in our future when it makes us the parents of the very dangerous and cruel children we've created.\"-Gloria Steinem, in The New York Times Book Review\n",

What Roberts has created here is a haunting novel about the ways that we forget who we are when we hit middle age, when we give up our sense of self and our identity in exchange for a sense of security and security in a kind of security, safety. As she reminds us, that sense of security (which often feels like a kind of madness) comes at a cost. The Key is an exploration of our willingness to let our kids become who they are, when we don't even know it's happening, and our unwillingness to let them know that we are who we are.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "1. The War of Independence\n",
      "\n",
      "The first real indication that the nation's government had begun to deteriorate came in 1776. That's when British commander Lord Dunmore declared war on the colonists, the act that sparked the Rebellion of 1775.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the conflict, the British continued to invade the nation and destroy it. On May 31, 1782, after a prolonged siege at Yorktown, the British finally defeated the colonists, leaving the government dissolved and the nation effectively ruined for over 200 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The war itself was fought in large part because of the perceived arrogance of George Washington. George was not a great commander, and although he had the support of most of his generals, Washington's arrogance made him the greatest threat to British power.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. American Independence Movement\n",
      "\n",
      "The British had been occupying the United States for 150 years, taking over land, forcing people to pay taxes, and destroying the economies of the country. The Americans were just as pissed off about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Declaration of Independence is a document that states the very foundation of American self-government. The document was created by Thomas Jefferson and the other Founding Fathers as a declaration of freedom for American colonists.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the greatest statement ever made by men of the time. It states, \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal\" and \"That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "3. New World Order\n",
      "\n",
      "The United Nations is a very strange and frightening organization. It is a big international government, with its headquarters in New York City and an office in each country where representatives and diplomats conduct its business.\n",

      "With their headquarters in New York City and offices in each of the United States, the UN is in a position to do just that, controlling every aspect of our lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's believed that the only reason why the world has not turned its back on the UN is because it can never be stopped, because it is so far entrenched in our countries, they can never take it over without a lot of bloodshed.\n",

      "4. The French Revolution\n",
      "\n",
      "France was a great place that had many problems in the 17th century and 1670s, but all of that changed in 1789 when the French Revolution broke out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The revolution started with a group of wealthy young businessmen who formed an alliance called the Constituent Assembly, and had an agenda that was centered on overthrowing the monarchy that had ruled France for 600 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the Constituent Assembly wasn't just interested in overthrowing the monarchy, but the monarchy itself. They wanted to create a new kind of monarchy that included the people, as well as a new type of law that would govern the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "To create this new law, they hired Thomas Jefferson, a man known to be opposed to the monarchy because of the way it operated. Jefferson was the architect of the Declaration of Independence, and in the beginning was very adamant about not allowing the revolution to go through. He was also very close friends with Benjamin Franklin, so it wasn't hard for him to not let the revolution happen.\n",
      "\n",

Just know that I just finished painting one panel, so there's more to it yet... and this isn't going to be finished until next Monday, or the 27th in this case.

      "For now, though, you can enjoy the first in a new series. All right, enough of this intro. It's time to get down to business!The first is the 'punch table' piece. A lot of work was put into it, and I'm very satisfied with how it turned out. I was happy because I really wanted the whole 'punch table' style of paneling for this project, but didn't want to go too overboard on the amount of detail... so, to keep things simple, I left everything, with a few exceptions, unchanged from the first image in the game.Here we go. In this image:One door, with 2 doors leading off from the right, 2 from the left, and two at the top. This panel took me a good 2 months of solid work to figure out how the doors would fit, and how the background would look when you were through them.I decided to do the entire thing over again to finish the 'table top' style. I've been working on this for a few weeks now, and finally feel like I'm in a position where I can finish it with some confidence... and with just a bit of practice. I'm going to be posting a picture of this soon of the final paneled piece (sans the punch table)... then I'm going to start on the next one... I'll give you guys a few more images from this once it's finished... I think.Now, for some other new content... I'll post another picture of the 'table top'-style panels... but I think for the time being, here's a few shots of the entire thing... and some pictures of the initial drawing I did.For a while, all I could think about was just how much I was going to use a few objects to make that punch-table look the absolute best it could... so here you go.First of all, as I mentioned, those 1 door panels are going to be a good deal more complicated than I originally thought. I have decided to add a few little tricks and changes to make them so that they should look exactly as I initially intended them to. They're also going to be a bit more elaborate than I might have thought initially, so I just wanted to let you guys have a peek first as I worked on them. I think you guys will like how it looks. This has been a lot of fun for me!I will be uploading another few pictures over this coming weekend (so you can look back at the first one).The next update, after this, will likely be much longer... I'm going to be continuing to work on the interior, and add more pictures of specific items for you guys to see.Once I'm done with the interior I'll upload a few pictures from the outside of this house. I do have a feeling I'm really going to be taking this to the next level, so I don't have a whole lot left to show of the outside of the house, and I'm not going to go overboard with the pictures I can post here... so for the time being, I have to save you guys. I'll be back at some point early next year, and then I'll be getting more serious. This may well be the last update I will do for this project until then.This is almost, in my opinion, the greatest little house you have ever seen, and I'm really happy to show you how much fun I got this time around with it.For the first round of panels I wanted a really dark background, that could make you really feel creepy if you walked alone through it. This house came so highly recommended to me by somebody I'd spoken to... someone who is VERY experienced with this style of building... and she was asking me if I could borrow any furniture she might have. So I took it. She also asked if I might be able to loan her some light fixtures, and I told her 'absolutely' if we could manage it. We did that for her. I actually don't think we even spoke that much. When she called me a couple days after I'd finished her house, asking if I could send a few of the light fixtures, I told her I wouldn't be able to because I was in the middle of something else, and that was the only contact I'd had.I had a lot of fun with this place. After seeing a few pictures I sent, she asked if I could get a couple of pictures of the house with the light fixtures installed in it, but I told her it just wouldn't be practical for me to do that, so I declined, to which\n",

      "The U.S. is a land of opportunity for a small group of investors that can afford to take on risk as part of a \"bubble\" strategy. The U.S. stock market bubble can explode but for now there is little danger to investors. This bubble strategy is similar to a pyramid in which the base is low and the peak is high. As the base and peak of the pyramid get closer together the odds of the pyramid collapsing increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many U.S. stocks are being issued by companies that have been trading at high PE ratios but are trading below their intrinsic value. There is an enormous amount of short interest in U.S. stocks so many investors believe stocks are being sold at lower prices than the value of the underlying asset. As a result these investors hold stocks at a discount. This strategy can be extremely profitable. If the discount on the stock is only a few percent and your profit expectations are high then this strategy might be profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a common belief among many that if the price gets to a PE ratio of 90 then the stock will be considered a bargain and investors would be able to purchase at a discount. PE is the ratio of the price of the stock to the earnings per share. In the case of U.S. stocks the PE number is calculated by dividing earnings per share (EPS) by the price of a share.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am going to try to debunk some common myths and raise my concerns about whether a PE ratio is a good measure of a company's value. Here are the facts about the P/E ratio and a few of the myths I see surrounding it. I am not going to address issues of valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth 1: It's a Good Index Number.\n",
      "\n",
      "The P/E measure, defined as sales divided by earnings per share, is actually an average of several different measurements. The most common is the price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio), a ratio that is calculated by dividing the earnings by the value of publicly traded stocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are other valuation measures such as the price-to-cashflow, price-to-earnings, price-to-book and price-to-sales ratio that are used to calculate a firm's valuation. You can read about some of these measures in the articles on valuation. You can't make an accurate P/E number at the stock level and you can't find a consistent definition of it. The companies that use the P/E ratio as the basis for value have always done so as a proxy for some value measurement. When a specific company uses the P/E ratio as the basis for valuation then this is called P/E targeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many use P/E as a proxy for some value metric such as price to book. The companies that use this measure generally have higher P/E percentages because earnings are higher per share than the price of some of the stocks. On the other hand, a lot of companies use the P/E measure as part of a broader valuation strategy such as price appreciation. This requires a higher P/E ratio, such as the P/E ratio of about 150 which is what is needed for companies using a valuation approach based on price appreciation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth 2: High PE Indicates a Good Value.\n",
      "\n",
      "The PE ratio is used in two different ways. The first is a measurement of the value of a company and the second is a measurement of how well a stock or company trades over time. The two are related. It is better to be high PE and have a good price-to-book or sales than to be high PE and trade poorly and have a low price-to-book. This is because a good stock trades faster. This is especially true when one considers P/B ratios and how companies tend to trade in small volumes. A high P/B is also important when considering the long term of a stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact some of the recent high PE stocks have traded as low as 5 and below. This is because they can trade at a P/B below 10 since they are trading at a discount to the value of their assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "It makes little sense to pay a premium for low P/E because the P/E ratio tells us nothing about the stock's value. For example, when you buy an S&P 500 index fund you are paying for the chance that the index will outperform the market on a given day. A stock with a 100 P/E ratio would be undervalued, because of the discount the stock offers, because a 10% stock discount (or discount to fair value) for every $1 increase in the price means the current stock price is a discount to fair value.\n",
      "\n",
      "An S&P 500 index fund with a PE of 100 is valued at $150 billion. An index fund with a PE of 40 is valued at $10 billion. The discount to fair value is just a dollar and a half for every $1 increase. For example, we could buy\n"

      "\"Carrying a concealed weapon in Virginia requires an individual to have a 'good and substantial reason' to carry that weapon; even if the good and substantial reason is justifiable in self-defense, the individual is still 'required to obtain a permit for each firearm under his control'â€¦Virginia has no right under the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution to create a private right of self-defense for its citizens.\" (U.S. v. Emerson, 978 F2d 1457, 1462 (4th Cir. 1992).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Virginia's statute contains a very general \"good and substantial reason\" requirement. The legislature found that if a citizen did carry a concealed weapon justifiably in self-defense, the police would be less likely to confiscate the weapon than if the citizen had just been carrying the weapon for personal purposes. In other words, a legitimate reason to carry a concealed weapon must be based on the citizen's interest in self-defense or \"lawful\" self-protection over \"public safety.\" While I agree that there may be an exception to this law, I argue that the Virginia statute is inconsistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Heller and with the majority opinion in Michigan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am certain that the majority is correct that there must be a show of good and substantial cause to justify the burden on a constitutional right. The law that prohibits carrying a concealed weapon does not contain a special exception, a show of good and substantial cause, or other qualifications. (Emerson, No. 2, Docket Nos. 88-813, 85-21-5). In an earlier case, the Court has expressly held that there must be a special \"proviso\" allowing certain exceptions. (United States v. Watson, 423 U.S. 411, 430 (1976).) The statute before us does not meet the test of rational basis. The statute simply prohibits a category of people from carrying at all. (See, e.g., United States ex rel. Zalewska v. Mabry, 623 F.2d 880, 886 (4th Cir. 1980).\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe that there is no special \"proviso\" allowing \"good and substantial reasons\" to carry a concealed firearm outside the home (or concealed carry without a permit, see U.S. v. Emerson, No. 6, Docket No. 88-813; U.S. v. Emerson, No. 5, Docket No. 88-812). Moreover, under the Supreme Court's case law, there must be a basis justifying the burden of a separate permit. In U.S. v. Miller, the Court has expressly upheld an exigent, excludable exception to an otherwise \"good and substantial reason\" requirement for carrying a firearm outside the home. Miller held that a citizen who \"has a well-founded fear of impending death or great bodily harm in the line of duty\" (emphasis added), and who believes that carrying a concealed firearm in public would not further this fear, may carry a firearm concealed at all times. (U.S. v. Miller/Kachalski, 743 F.2d 752, 754 (9th Cir. 1984).) In this same case, the Court acknowledged that a \"well-founded fear of imminent, violent attack does not justify the exercise of a constitutional rightâ€¦to bear arms for personal self-defense.\" (Id.). If this is the test, there would be no need for a show of good and substantial reason, as, under the majority opinion in Michigan, if it is reasonable for a citizen to use force in resisting an unlawful arrest or unlawful detention, the citizen may resist an unlawful seizure and carry a concealed firearm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it is my view that the Supreme Court did not intend for courts to decide whether self-defense justifies the burden of a permit requirement, but only whether the burden is excessive. The Court does not say whether permitting the citizen to carry a concealed firearm is reasonable or not. Rather, it simply holds that \"a person claiming a right to bear arms, but who does not possess one, must be permitted by law to carry the weapon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I also believe that this is a case for decision on remand, and I am hopeful that the Virginia Court of Appeals will follow the Supreme Court's direction and decide the case on remand to focus on the \"good and substantial reason\" question, in order to resolve the case on the merits and not on collateral issues.\n",

      "When the U.S. Senate voted on President Donald Trump's tax reform proposal this week, Democratic senators were quick to call out senators for failing to address the country's rising levels of income inequality. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden tweeted that \"the bill fails to address the issue of income inequality on a bipartisan basis and with a comprehensive analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Joint Committee on Taxation, the nonpartisan congressional tax body, has concluded that tax reform proposals should raise the tax burden on those making $1 million or more every year. For Americans with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000, it would mean tax rates on the top 1 percent would increase by an average of almost 20 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Income inequality was one of the main areas of focus for progressive Democrats during the 2016 presidential campaign, and has been a key aspect of their agenda since. For most of the last three years, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has been campaigning against the \"billionaire class,\" while Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton sought to build a campaign on the theme of offering Americans a \"fair shot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Senate bill is a victory for the very rich,\" Ryan Ellis, vice president for policy at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a non-profit that advocates for progressive policies, told The Huffington Post.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It doesn't solve middle class economics problems, but it does protect a set of special interests, and that's the 1 percent who currently has the highest tax burdens,\" Ellis added. \"The way we go forward in the future is to make sure rich people have a bigger cut of the pie and that the next time we have an economic downturn, that we're looking at more spending on unemployment and food stamps and making sure that we don't create another disaster for future generations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ellis and other progressive Democrats are also calling out Senators for failing to make comprehensive, detailed proposals on tax policy. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called out Republican Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) for failing to respond to Democrats' demands during the 2016 presidential campaign. McCain and McConnell have both been critical of progressive policies in the past, including the Affordable Care Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a bill that makes almost no compromises between the tax cuts for the super wealthy and their cuts to services for all Americans,\" Warren wrote in a letter to all Senate Democrats last week before voting on Wednesday to approve the bill. \"These bills are a giveaway to corporations and the wealthy at the expense of the rest of us. That's the truth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) blasted his Republican colleagues for giving corporate tax cuts \"a pass,\" while Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) took to Facebook to call the bill the \"Trump bill.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have just seen the Trump tax bill for the first time,\" he wrote. \"It is terrible legislation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, Democrats and progressive groups praised the GOP tax plan for providing relief to struggling middle class households. But Republicans are now likely to face the criticism again come next year's midterm elections.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"People in [Democrats'] districts are very unhappy with the lack of any specifics,\" Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) told HuffPost. \"They don't know where it's going to be or what they're going to be paying taxes on or what the tax plan is going to look like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Income inequality was a major theme of the 2016 presidential race, and was among the main topics discussed by the White House during a recent meeting with Congressional leaders, as well as by President Donald Trump in recent public speeches. \"We're going to be lowering the rates for middle-income people,\" he said. \"We will be bringing the rates down for the middle-income people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, Democrats argue that the U.S. needs to move toward a more progressive income tax. They have argued for decades that high and rising taxes on the wealthy are responsible for the problems plaguing the economy, including a weak recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, among many others, believes that the United States needs to look at taxing the incomes of the top 1 percent of tax filers starting at $480,000. Meanwhile, conservative organizations including the American Enterprise Institute, Freedomworks and the Club for Growth oppose that measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The U.S. has a major problem with inequality that is real, which is that there is a strong relationship between income inequality and a decline in social trust,\" Ellis pointed out. \"And when you have higher levels of inequality, you also have more and more political gridlock, which means less accountability of the political process, more political corruption, more political conflict between different constituencies of the United States.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I think that we have to be cautious about just taxing the top 1 percent,\" Ellis added. \"We have to look at the whole picture.\"\n"

      "It's not because I haven't seen an XFL game, but because if I want to do something fun like watch an NFL game and go for a walk, I need to get a good week in before I kick off my holiday plans. With all the parties being thrown, and all the people around me, I haven't had any free time to catch up on any of the TV shows. There's no real reason to start now. It's all right if I wait until next week on Wednesday, but the real fun is over already. I'm not going out into the cold and let someone I know and love stumble into my life. I'm going out to a cool bar and maybe catch a game I didn't see while I was at work. Not to mention, I can't just grab a few beers and walk away from it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like to keep a low profile, and this year's holiday party season has been full of people, bars, and people talking. I'm not interested in that. I want to celebrate with family and friends, not some random stranger at the bar. This particular night isn't one of those parties I need to be at, so I don't have a date. You know what happens when I don't have a planned weekend? I end up driving to bars. It's happened several times this year, when I'm trying to do something other than what I usually do, and I end up having a night out. Sometimes I'm on my phone, other times I'm talking to other people. I'm doing whatever I've got going on to do something cool, and then I turn my attention to the car radio, then the TV, and all the TVs I need my ears to adjust to.\n",

      "The last time I had a drink in the car, I found myself sitting next to a friend of mine in a car because we were driving home from dinner. I had a few hours off work for Thanksgiving, and my girlfriend (who was driving) asked to stop at a neighborhood bar for a midnight drink with me. Our plan involved going to \"the place we go\" for drinking that night. We had some drinks, then a nap, and went out to get dinner and a movie. Our friend came and sat with us in the parking lot. We didn't really talk much, but I knew that my friend needed rest, so I decided to head home to take a nap. I'm not a great at sleeping in the car, because my bed always looks different. I have an armrest under the seat, a canopy thing that's up against the sun visor, and I'm always wearing a hat, and it can get pretty hot there. The next few hours were like a movie. The car felt like it was moving faster than normal, the tires were on the dirt road, my friend kept nagging me about the movies he wants to catch on television, and my heart was just a little bit heavier knowing I had to wake her up tomorrow to finish this day.\n",
      "\n",
      "I woke up early, and left my friend on the passenger's seat, hoping we would make the drive to the bar without the guy talking, and I could relax on the backseat. As we pulled into a driveway, one hand found its way in between two of my teeth, and I had to hold down the other hand just to keep from letting go. My friend asked if she could stay with me. I was surprised that yes. The fact that I needed a partner was a bit of a shock. I don't have friends that I can really spend hours with, but when someone's willing to give me a ride home for the night, they just have to be someone I can talk to for a few minutes when I need a little reassurance. I know a lot of girls get this question a lot because of who the other people in the car were. And I'm fine with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we arrived at the bar, and I sat next to my friend again, I noticed a guy in the backseat watching something on ESPN-type channel. I guess you can call this \"watching\" television â€“ he wasn't doing much of anything, probably just staring. And then he glanced our way as a couple got to the door, maybe to pick up the tabs. He looked back once, but I quickly got up to ask him not to stare. Before I left, I turned back to him, and told him I liked talking about sports with him. He nodded his head and I took the backseat so he could talk with us about something else.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't know it then, but that guy was going to be a major supporting character to my story. I was looking forward to that conversation. I was also a bit nervous because one of my friend's sisters was at the bar, and the other person I was talking to turned out to be a guy. And so, the conversation went like this:\n",

Yet, the Walt Disney Company's earnings were nearly 10 times that of Apple Inc, another well-known firm with high-value growth and low-tax exposure through its offshore subsidiaries.

Women working full-time would have been able to earn up to $12,000 a year on average â€” though the bill, as it was proposed, didn't define full-time or even part-time. In November, Missouri Senate leaders killed a bill proposing to raise the state's minimum wage to $10, up from its current $7.70 an hour. And just a week ago, the Republican supermajority on the Missouri Public Service Commission voted down a proposal by a liberal Democrat to raise the state minimum wage to $10 an hour over three years.\n",

Some states, like New York and New Jersey, have higher capes. The current wage for a full-time female worker in the Missouri is $15.32 an hour, though the state Department of Labor has proposed raising this to \"the equivalent of $16.00 per hour by 2017.\"\n",

      "It's worth noting that, historically speaking, women have had the opportunity to make more when they start a family. The first federal minimum wage, set in 1938, was $5 an hour for teenagers and $2.75 an hour for full-time women.

They did nothing but time me. Now I am being killed because of your false arrest Wasting my 23 year career. You can not police yourselves and the consent decree was unsustainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact is, Dorner killed two officers. If he was a good cop, he wouldn't have killed two good cops, but a bad cop, killing two good cops. Now if Dorner was like other good cops who had bad days, there's no way his reputation would be damaged. When we say good cops make bad cops, we're speaking about good cops acting like good cops, then bad cops acting like bad cops. If Dorner is any good cop, his bad day would never have happened, so he can't possibly have been a bad cop. So if a bad cop who only has bad days acted like a good cop, he wouldn't have been any good at all.\n",

Or a good cop who gets bad days, his bad day could have been averted, and he wouldn't have killed two good cops. So now if one good cop is acting like a bad cop and kills two good cops, Dorner doesn't say he killed good cops. Or Dorner says he killed good cops. And this is where the problem stops being just with Dorner, it becomes a problem with all police. All cops. Police who try to be good, and cops who try to be bad. Because you can't police people who try to be good. You can't police people who try to be bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's the problem. As far as LAPD officers go, the top one percent of officers are extremely good. It'd be like a police sergeant or captain working at a McDonalds or Taco Bell. And as far as bad cops are, it'd be like someone trying to be a cop at a McDonalds or Taco Bell. As to the average cop on the street, you'd think the cops in the top ten percent of officers are incredibly good, but then you'd realize that most average cops are terrible. They are really awful people. They are bad to the core. They are corrupt. They are lying, stealing, beating, killing. It'd be like the top 10 percent were all really good and the bottom 10 percent were all really bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "And for good police officers, bad days always come. On a daily basis, and you never see this, the bad cops who try to be good beat the good cops who don't try to be good, and the good cops who try to be good beat the bad cops who don't try to be good. On a daily basis at an average police station, this goes on 24 hours a day with no end in sight. It's the ultimate corrupt system of police and police management.\n",

The Mars in that picture could also be a planet Venus made into a star, although in an earlier time, Venus was one of many possible star systems we might encounter.

There's a chance Android Oreo could start showing up on your Android phone within the next few days, but most Android phones can't currently receive it or even have it on the list of Android builds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Android Oreo includes a lot of new features, but the biggest one is certainly the system-level changes to the operating system. Some of these features may not have reached your device yet because Android OS developers have been working on their own updates.\n",

      "For example, Android Oreo is not going to be in the next Android security patches because Google is still not ready to push a new one just yet because the security issues are still being resolved. So this is a gap that Google and other Android partners that help develop new versions of Android want to fill on their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily, it appears Google has a plan and a timeline to get Android Oreo up to your phone. According to SamMobile, the Android OS developer team is still trying to get all the features on its wish List ready and in line, so they could begin pushing out the update as early as December 13.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are already four Android O Preview releases coming from third-party developers. We saw the O Preview 7 last month, but now we have a release candidate version 8. We also saw a Release Candidate version 5 last last week (yes, there is also a version 4).\n",

      "One of the biggest additions in Oreo to the operating system is a new permission system dubbed Developer Options .

      "The new iPad was always expected to launch right around when the iPad mini came out, which gives some additional time to make it work on the 12\" tablet. With Apple's own event just a couple of weeks away, Apple has finally launched their iPad mini competitor and the new 13\" iPad mini with Retina display. The new iPads go on sale tomorrow, November 25thth, and in typical Apple fashion they feature some pretty cool features.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new iPad mini features a dual layer design, the first time we've seen it. That means it has two transparent layers like the iPad 2 and the Apple A5 chip used in iOS 7. The first layer is made of a high quality sapphire crystal so it's resistant to scratches, and while it won't scratch your iPad, it does make it a bit thicker to fit into your bag or purse. The second layer on the new iPad mini features Gorilla Glass, which is a protective layer built onto the screen but doesn't offer as much protection. Apple calls these the \"anti-reflective\" and \"non-glare\" designs (more on those later). The new iPad mini's main display will still be a Retina display, which also has the benefit of offering increased battery life if you're really worried about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also new is the Touch ID feature that lets users unlock the new iPads with just their fingers. Once your finger makes contact with the home button on the new iPad mini, the fingerprint sensor will read your thumb's fingerprint pattern and confirm it was indeed you who locked the iPad. Touch ID also has the added benefit of keeping your fingers away from the camera and the speakers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apple's new iPad was rumored to be able to hold an optical drive for added storage, and while that's not a requirement right now, they did include both an SD card slot and a nano-SIM slot in the box with Apple's devices. We didn't expect Apple to do this with such an inexpensive device, and they did it for a reason. The new iPad mini is meant to provide users with more storage than the typical 12\" tablet, because the screen size of the device is just a bit smaller than the iPad mini is. This means additional storage could be installed via a micro-USB port if you don't have an SD card reader like the old iPad mini.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new iPads also feature a better speakers and a larger screen that puts a lot more noise on your ears. Apple included a pair of front-facing microphones with the new iPads in order to ensure better sound, so the speakers are louder and offer a better sound quality. There will also be new iPads with wireless charging. While this only seems like a good thing if you happen to be carrying your device on your daypack or something, wireless charging is a standard feature on most smartphones so we should all be able to adapt. One last interesting feature is that the new iPads offer the same 3G/HSPA+ capabilities that the iPhone 6's did this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last new feature we're interested in is the use of an accelerometer inside the new iPads that allows the device to automatically rotate to face a user's direction of motion. You might recognize this as Apple's Smart Keyboard, which debuted on the iPad mini and allowed it to automatically orient itself to your typing position. While it's a good feature, the accelerometer and Touch ID seem like a better way to solve the task because of the ability to track your hand position over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new iPads have a new back cover which Apple describes as being thinner, more rigid, and more durable. It adds no extra functions, but just makes the new iPads lighter in terms of weight. It's also worth noting the new iPad minis feature a Lightning connector, whereas the iPad mini 2 did not.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new iPads all have Wi-Fi calling capability, and they all include the same Lightning ports. Apple offers a 3G network with Verizon for the new iPad as well as AT&T and T-Mobile in the U.S. There is no specific 4G LTE support for the new iPads, but AT&T seems to have a great deal of interest in the new 12\" tablets.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can now pre-order the new iPads from all three of Apple's retail stores, as well as Amazon and Best Buy for a few more days. The 11.6\" iPad mini with WiFi calling is slated to ship on October 20th in the U.S., and on November 25th overseas.\n",

      "Also joining the 13\" iPad mini line-up is the 7\" iPad Pro. The iPad Pro has a slightly smaller display with only 1,366 x 768 pixels though it uses a brand new A9X chip from Nvidia which will let it run more demanding games and apps.

      "The pirate nation of Barrayar was founded upon the principles of piracy, and had a reputation for being the most dangerous in the known world and the most feared.[3] It was said that a Barrayar captain had to be a great warrior to survive for long at sea.

They formed the Zhentarim, a pirate organization that would rule the known world for centuries to come.[2]\n",
      "\n",
      "During the Second Blight, the pirates of Zhentil Keep raided the lands of Sasserine, seeking to reclaim the pirate treasure buried there. The Zhentarim also sought to prevent the return of Mab and thus were also willing to aid the forces of Lord Naarifin and the White Raven when they rebelled against their leaders. In a battle lasting several days, the Zhentarim destroyed the Sasserine army with the aid of Lord Naarifin, but were themselves overwhelmed, and Mab's forces managed to break free of Barrayar's grasp.[2]\n",

      "By -500 DR, the Zhentarim, after being forced from power and exiled to the Shadowfell,[2] formed the Red Diamond, a band of pirates who fought against their former associates. They eventually went into hiding and formed an organization, the Sea Hag, to seek to recapture and return the pirate treasure and the honor of the Zhentarim to the Black Heart's original masters.[2]\n",
      "\n",
      "This led to a war that lasted several years and ultimately resulted with the fall of the Zhentarim, Lord Naarifin and most of the other pirate leaders to the forces of their former allies in the forces of Vhaeraun.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the war, the remnants of the Zhentarim fled to a land near Torm, on the northern coast of Ashaba. In this land, the Zhentarim maintained a new base, an island stronghold, which was named Gurn, after Vhaeraun. There the pirates remained hidden until the time when a group of men of noble descent came to reclaim their former homeland. The members of this group were called the Knights of the Black Heart and for a time, they were under the leadership of an ex-pirate named Tix'rias.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually, Tix'rias was killed, and Tix'rias's brother Arvak assumed leadership of the Sea Hag, the remnant of the Zhentarim. This group took their name from the fact that their new homeland consisted mainly of large sea monsters. Their name has remained unchanged, even after centuries, from the time of Zhentil Keep's fall. Eventually, the Knights were led by a man called Skorvak. They began to spread terror across the Sea of Fallen Stars and also raided the lands of the people of the Heart of Maguuma and their allies.[2]\n",
      "\n",
      "Over time, Skorvak and Skordak's forces were defeated by Skwisgaar Thunderhoof, who led an army of all the dragons to Ashaba in -1E 861, slaying the Sea Hag and establishing the kingdom of Kryta. Over the course of the centuries, Skorvak would make several attempts to take control over Kryta by using Tix'rias's sword, the Heart of the Dragon, to enslave the dragons. This time around, the Dragons of Kryta had a new leader in Skordak, who also sought to lead another invasion of the land. The dragon armies battled the Knights, but were eventually defeated. Skorvak made his escape, but not before being killed by the Dragon of the North, who had gone back to his people, after having been separated from his children during a war with the giants to whom he once belonged. This final battle resulted in Skordak's\n"

It was founded in 1979, and was headed until the early 2000s by Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, who was Iran's current president and has maintained the Quds Force's political and military presence in Afghanistan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Quds force is an elite military, political and diplomatic arm of the Iranian government that carries out foreign policies for the Iranian regime. It was established in 1979 following the revolutionary victory of the Islamic clergy and the 1979 overthrow of the democratic government of the Shah of Iran. This decision was based on the Shiite religion; the Imam Reza shrine is located in the northern city of Mashad, and the Islamic Republic believes that Imam Reza represents the true messianic figure of the Shia sect that arose through the persecution of Sunni Muslims during the seventh century. Shiites believe that Imam Reza, their founder, is still alive, and that he will return in the near future, though this prediction is very uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Quds force, with its headquarters in the Qoms area of northwestern Iran, has been linked to attacks throughout Central Asia in recent months â€” and it is likely that attacks will continue, particularly against Israel.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Quds force's current commander is Major General Qassem Soleimani, an experienced military tactician that oversees the Quds force's military activities; he also serves as the chief of staff of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. Soleimani was given the position of chief of staff from 2006 to 2008.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm a big believer in God. When God created us, he gave us intelligence and strategy and tactics,\" said Soleimani during a speech to the country of Kuwait in 2010. Soleimani continued, \"I believe that God is involved in our wars, and we have no choice but to use intelligence and tactics that are to make our lives more comfortable.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To do that, he said, is to use all the resources of Iranian military forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "While working as an officer in the Quds force, Soleimani has reportedly worked together with Pakistani-born Ali Fadavi, the founder of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. Fadavi, a Hezbollah commander and an operative of Lebanese Shiite terrorists (known by the acronym Fatah al-Islam Hezbollah), is a notorious terrorist whose organization has carried out numerous attacks on Israel. Fadavi recently called on the entire Shiite community abroad to participate in Hezbollah-led attacks against Israel. (This call was ignored by the Quds force.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Soleimani was responsible for coordinating operations in Afghanistan, and he has used the Quds force's military resources, including its Qods Force, to support Hezbollah in several attacks against Israelis. Soleimani has been involved in many operations with Iranian officials, such as the recent assassination of a Hezbollah operative in Syria. Other operations reportedly involved the Quds force and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, including the Iranian takeover of the Afghan province of Khost in January 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to conducting attacks, the Quds force also is involved in a variety of diplomatic and political activities. Since 2012, a number of Quds Force officials reportedly have accompanied Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, in his diplomatic travels, and the Quds Force's personnel have been involved in a number of Iran's overseas missions, such as the signing of an international agreement with Venezuela to limit Iran's enrichment of uranium.\n",

The ships were reportedly heading to Syria, where Iran's government has been supporting its ally, President Bashar al-Assad.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, Soleimani's role seems to be relatively minor. In contrast to the United States' extensive presence in the Middle East, Iran has limited its diplomatic and military presence. It has focused on exporting energy and economic development, and it does not have many military assets it could use to back its allies. However, Soleimani's current position has increased the stature of the Quds force in Iran and has given it an aura of importance in Iran. Iran may see the Quds Force as a crucial tool with which to deter Western intervention in the Middle East and to project its influence in the region.\n",

I was invited to meet these journalists not through the usual channels of Chinese media, but rather through a Facebook group called \"Chinese Women in Global Media.\" For those that don't know, China has a well-documented problem of women's representation both as politicians, business leaders and journalists. This is due to Chinese culture, that is, the traditional sexism on both an interpersonal and social level in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "My visit to Beijing with this group was a fascinating experience. While I know many of the young American journalists are working hard and doing excellent work, this group was more interested in discussing the \"Chinese way\" as well as exploring China as a place to photograph. They shared many stories of their experiences of working in China as women, even having had one woman express a desire to \"cut her hair short\" in the hope of being more attractive and garnering some positive feedback from Chinese men. I think these young Chinese journalists are at an early stage in their career development and are still getting comfortable photographing in China and this sort of stereotyping is not uncommon amongst younger journalists. They're learning and growing.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also shared with me a concern that I have also seen in other young American female journalists. This is that after many years reporting in China, the women feel out of place when they arrive because of the gender stereotypes that remain in the public at large. Many of these young Americans were asked about their favorite Chinese restaurant in China, their favorite thing to do while waiting there for a taxi, or anything concerning social customs they would like to see change. Their answer was often a negative one. They told me that what they really hoped to see was an increase of more women of all ages participating in political decisions and more women of all ethnic and religious backgrounds serving in positions of power in the Chinese government, just like they see in the Western world. However, they also said China needs more female journalists because \"the only way [they] can feel like they're making a contribution is through making the story.\"\n",

      "For the past three years David Moseley has been working in the Bay Area. He is a computer programmer. Moseley was part of a group of engineers and software developers who were interested in creating a solution that allowed them to do business with a local agency that had a major customer who did not want to deal with the cost of shipping.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem was that the agency did not carry the hardware or software needed to get their work done. The only available option to the customer was a local courier company called UPS.\n",
      "\n",
      "For some users of Amazon's Web site, it is only a matter of time until they need to receive packages through the service â€” either to deliver them to their home or to pick up another package from an Amazon fulfillment center. In the meantime, Amazon gets to keep charging the user a percentage of each order. The only way to avoid paying with a percentage is to pay by the mile, which is what local courier companies do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moseley says they contacted some smaller vendors including FedEx Ground and FedEx Priority and tried to figure out how they could get an order to the customer the same day it was placed. The customer was happy they could now order from a local dealer and did not have to worry about shipping fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The problem was that this was one of a number of cases where I could either do things locally or pay a premium by the day. But if they had used FedEx the only thing we would have done was move to FedEx ground, which isn't a service we would necessarily recommend,\" Moseley told us. \"We got really curious if there was a solution for our problem that someone else had solved before.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Moseley says that he and another software engineer created a prototype. They took it to a small startup incubator in the Bay Area called Noodle. Since the incubator was not connected with Amazon he needed to convince them to host the software, he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The idea kind of caught on quickly,\" he says. \"This year we have built and built and built a lot. The project started out with a few engineers, some prototypes, and we got all of the engineers to make the product. It took all year to get from there to the current version we have.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Moseley told us the team is now moving forward on a commercial prototype and looking for a manufacturing partner. According to the startup incubator Noodle, the project is in the final phase of development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bay Area has a number of well respected local delivery companies. For instance, UPS has a huge hub in San Francisco and a number of smaller, local, companies have locations across northern and central California that service Amazon.com.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moseley says the problem they are trying to solve is an issue that the Bay Area has been seeing for decades, that small tech companies that sell directly to the customer often struggle to deal with shipping costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know if we have the solution. But the reason we are talking about this problem is because we live in the Bay Area,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moseley says the team is hoping to raise $100,000 to build and launch a commercial product and to help with the costs of marketing.\n",
